# home-sales

This is the Module 22 Challenge for Rice University's Data Analytics & Visualization boot camp.

In this challenge, we used your knowledge of SparkSQL to determine key metrics about home sales data. Then we used Spark to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncache a temporary table, and verify that the table has been uncached.

The code for this challenge is contained in the "Home_Sales_colab" file on the main branch. It was written and run in Google Colab, so for best results please run the code in Colab as well.

Over and out!
